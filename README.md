## Overview

Generation Knit is a pattern charing website, built to address the need for a modern, responsive and accesbile website in the online knitting space. It provides a space for users to upload and share pattterns for knitting and crochet

## Project Goals 

For my fourth portfolio projects, I wanted to create a project that both showcased my proficiency with databases, Bootstrap and Django. My project goal is to show that I can use these tools effectively in a creative way.

Generation Knit serves as a platform to both share and find knitting patterns. The goal was to create a platform that stores the information that comes with a knitting pattern and display it back to the user in an attractive and intuitive. The largest community based knitting website on the internet has long been criticized for its confusing layout and lack of accessibilty for visually impaired users. My website aims to address these issues.

## What happened to Generation Knit 1.0? 

I started work on the first version of this project in October 2023. After multiple issues with Codeanywhere, I was advised by Code Institute to start again from scratch on Gitpod. I quickly rebuilt my project as Generation Knit 2.0. The original project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/carlalennon/portfolio-project-4). I started this current project again in January 2024. 

In my job, I do a lot of overtime. This restart was daunting to me, but by working on the project every day I slowly built up a new project from scratch. 

## UX Design

I wanted a simple home page to let the images speak for themselves. Looking at the images is the most pleasurable part of browsing knitting patterns, it should no be marred by stray information all over the page.

For the feed, I settled with having the absolute bare minimum of information available so the picture stand out on their own. This is in direct opposition to other knitting websites, where the tendency is to have information everywhere cluttering up the page and affecting the enjoyment of the browsing experience. 

I created many wireframes for this project, some just to get the look of the site down, and more practical ones. They are included in the wireframe section below. 

I endevoured to create a site that adhered to UX principles. Information is neatly stored and displayed upon request. The website is laid out in a way that is easy to use. 

I created hand-drawn logo and icons for the nav bar, to create some personality for the site 

## Accessibilty Focus

The largest knitting website on the web often receives criticism for its lack of accessibilty to vision-impaired crafters. This is expecially bad when so many elderly people knit, and can be vision impaired. My site is laid out in a way that colourblind users can still use the site. The icons in the nav bar are designed to be distincy from each other so vision impaired users will not have any problems differentiating them. I have also tried to adhered to accessibility guidelines from W3 Schools to improve the site experience for the visually impaired.


## User Avatar

My site user avatar: 
- Young person looking for a modern knitting site
- Like fibre craft, dislikes cluttered UI of extant sites
- Is challenged in finding and sharing knitting patterns in existing social media platforms
- Wants to upload patterns or share those they've found online


## Site Goals

My site goals are as follows: 

- Provide a modern responsive interface for users
- Provide a place for users to discover new patterns
- Provide a place for users to share new patterns they write 
- Provide a place for user to share patterns they find
- Allow users to search patterns by keyword and category
- Allow users to create and customise a profile to showcase their personality 

## Agile Method

I used the agile method to develop my project. I wrote [user stories](https://github.com/carlalennon/generation-knit-2.0/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20project%3Acarlalennon%2F4) and mapped them to a [kanban board](https://github.com/users/carlalennon/projects/4/views/1). I then broke my user stories into tasks and completed the tasks one by one. I also assigned labels to my issues so I can see what they are better.


### User Stories

For Agile development, user stories are an important part of the process. They allow developers to plan according to the needs of the user. This ensures that important steps for the user's experience aren't overlooked in developement. 

On my kanban board, user stories are marked as Must Have, Could Have, or Beautify. Beautify is for styling that doesn't affect functionality.

My user stories are as follows: 

- Users Story: Registration
- User Story: Homepage/Feed
- User Story: Pattern Detail Page
- User Story: User Profile
- User Story: Search for patterns
- User Story: Navigation Bar
- User Story: Upload a Pattern

This can be viewed in closer detail in the [issues section of this project](https://github.com/carlalennon/generation-knit-2.0/issues).

## Structure

### Features

#### Home Feed 

Users have access to a home feed that shows all patterns currently uploaded to Generation Knit. This allows for organic discovery of new patterns 

![Home page](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-features-home-page.png)

#### Nav Bar

To keep the layout as clean as possible, the site utilises a nav bar that pops in from the side. The bar is decorated with hand drawn icons to give the site some identity.

![Nav Bar](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-features-menu.png) 

#### Pattern Detail Page

Each pattern has a detail page where details about the pattern are neatly stored. They are available to access under the collapsing tabs. From this page, the user can also follow a link to the pattern source, or download a link of the pattern'd PDF file.

![Detail page](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-features-pattern-detail.png)

#### Search

Users can search for patterns using either a key word or a filter of the pattern's categorys.

![Search page](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-features-search.png)

#### Upload a Pattern

If a user has an account, they can upload their pattern to the website to share it with the world. The user has a choice of uploading a PDF directly or linking to a shop page if their pattern is available for sale on another site, such as Etsy or Ravelry.

![Upload a pattern](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-features-upload-pattern.png)

#### Profile

Upon signing up, users are given a profile. They can customise their bio and picture to share something about themselves. The profile page also displays the amount of patterns uploaded by a user. It displays a list of patterns created by the user at the bottom of the page.

![User profile](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-features-profile.png)


###  Future Features

- Add multiple image uploads to patterns
- Add Cloudinary upload widget to forms for ease of use for user
- Give user the option to change a pdf to an external link or vice versa after pattern is posted
- Allow users to add custom alt text to images they upload
- Add Google Maps integration to allow users to find local yarn store
- Create a Javascript tool that allows users to chart a pattern and download the result as an image
- Add more pattern category options, more needle and yarn sizes


## Design

For Generation Knit, I wanted an extremely streamlined design. The web's major knitting website has information everywhere, nested search bars, and is extremely cluttered and hard for new users to navigate. I wanted the opposite of that. 

It also sports a garish orange colour scheme. For knitting patterns, it can take hours to find the perfect pattern that suits your materials and skill level. The orange also tends to overshadow the beauty of the pieces themselves. I chose a neutral colour palette for a modern look that allows the patterns to pop on the screen.

The other website also has extremely poor mobile compaitibility. I chose to build my site with a mobile-first approach, so that users may enjoy the browsing experience without the hassle of tiny links and images on a smartphone. 

To stop the grey site becoming too stale, I designed a set of hand-drawn assets for the nav bar to bring in an organic look.

### Colours 

I chose a colour scheme that is accessible to visually impaired users, and that lets the patterns pop on their own without interference from a bright background colour.

I chose colours with a contrast ratio of 7 or above to keep my site accessible to the visually impaired.

### Typography 

The font used in the Generation Knit logo is "Chantal" from the Adobe Font selection. However, I bypassed loading the extra font into the site by creating the logo and exporting it as a PNG file in Photoshop.


## Languages

### Git 

I used git for version control on this project. Version control allows me to track and control changes to the project. It also allows me to restore older versions of the project should something go wrong. 

I tracked my project using git. I wrote a small descriptive note for each commit to github.

### Django 

I used Django to build my project. Django is a Python framework for developing web apps. Django comes with security features built in to keep sensitive data hidden. It is a popular framework and is widely used in professional development settings. 

I especially liked the tag system, as the tags can accept logical arguments. These can be used to determine whether to show certain HTML or iterate over database entries.


### JavaScript

I used Javascript in combination with Bootstrap to make my website neater and more responsive to the user. A javascript feature of note is the hambuger menu in which the navigation tags are hidden. This allows less visual clutter on the page for the user. It is especially effective for mobile users.

Javascript is not installed in this project, rather it is loaded in using a tag in base.html. The tag is based on the bottom of the page to improve loading times.


### Bootstrap

I used Bootstrap to design the HTML of my website. 

Bootstrap is a front-end development framework available for free on the web. While I am not a Bootstrap expert, I endeavoured to use it to create a pleasant frontend experience and neat HTML.

### CSS 

I used a small amount of custom CSS to style certain aspects of my project. To serve the CSS, each change to custom.css had to be made in VS Code on my PC, saved, uploaded to Cloudinary and refreshed on order to show changes.

### Python 

I used Python to build my views and models. I checked the python was formatted correctly in a Python linter, and adhered to this. The exception is segments where the line length is too long. These are left in as in case this results in broken code.

## Testing and Validation

### Performance Testing

Network testing was done using Chrome devtools. My image loading is very slow, in the future I will look into why this is and how to correct it. I think the issue may be that my images aren't optimised fully.

I upload images using sorl thumbnail's Imagefield, but deliver them with Cloudinary. Before swapping out Sorl Thumbnail for Cloudinary, testing was so slow that Lighthouse could not test my pages and app would not run on Heroku which gives an error after 30 seconds of page loading.

![Waterfall showing slow image loading](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-network-testing.png)

I also did some troubleshooting on slow database queries. While not always slow, they sometimes are causing delays in the site. I had to choose an American server to get an up-to-date verison of PostgreSQL, which may also be contributing to load times. In my research, most sources said that this would likely be solved by upgrading to a paid plan with ElephantSQL. 

![Showing slow queries and recommended time of 1ms or less](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-network-postgres.png)

I also tried to use Lighthouse to test what exactly was the issue on the page, but it wouldn't test and only returned this error. 

![Lighthouse error](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-network-lighthouse.png)

Along with a similar error from PageSpeed Insights. 

![PageSpeed Insights error](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-network-pagespeedinsights.png)

I am using sorl thumbnail for image resizing results are slow. Here's an example of a typical server response:

![Server response of 10 seconds](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-network-server-timing.png)


Here are my more successful Lighthouse tests:

    </details>

The site is still slow, I am not happy with the loading times. In the future, I would run more tests to see why my site is so slow and what I can do to optimise it further.

### Linting 

#### HTML

I used the W3C schools linter to check my html. It does not like Django tags, so my goal was to solve every error it gave apart from the Django related errors. 

The HTML linter really didn't like Django, and showed a lot of errors in all HTML with Django tags

![Django errors in W3 HTML checker ](templates/assets/images/readme/readme-lint-django.png)

I used "Validate by Direct Input"

I worked through errors in my code until only the Django related errors were left. 

Some common errors:


  <summary> Button cannot be a child of an "a" tag</summary>
    <IMG src="templates/assets/images/readme/readme-lint-common-01.png"  alt="Button cannot be a child of an a tag error "/>
    </details>

  <summary> Image tags require an alt attribute (I had been using "name" as an alt )</summary>
    <IMG src="templates/assets/images/readme/readme-lint-common-02.png"  alt="Image tags require an alt attribute error"/>
    </details>

  <summary> Stray tags </summary>
    <IMG src="templates/assets/images/readme/readme-lint-common-03.png"  alt="Stray tag error"/>
    </details>


#### Python

I used an ![online Python formatter](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_python_formatter.htm) to paste each python file into to observe the differences. I then manually made changes to each file. I did not want to use an automatica linter to avoid breaking any of my Django

#### CSS

I used ![a CSS linter](csslint.net) to check my CSS file. It gave me 6 warnings for the !important tag in my CSS. However, I decided to keep these in because the custom CSS would not appear without them. I believe this is because my Bootstrap is served from a CDN. Installing Bootstrap to the static folder in Cloudinary appendsa random string to each file. Even when this is removed, the Bootstrap files are still broken. This prevented me from using SASS customisation.

### Responsive Design 

Responsiveness testing was carried out using Chrome Devtools. Special care was given to the pages that undergo large layout changes between large and small screens. These are 

- Search Page 
- Profile page

In the future I would like to add further layout changes to 

- Add pattern form
- Edit pattern form
- Edit profile form
- Login/Sign Up page
- Pattern detail page

This is discussed more in the known issues section

## Deployment

For deployment I did the following:
 - Created a Heroku account following the steps in the LMS
 - Created a new Heroku app, paying attention to region (EU) 
 - Went to "Config Vars" in settings
 - - Added vars for Cloudinary and ElephantSQL, disabled collect static, added a PORT for 8000
 - - Added the secret key for my Django app
 - Collected the static files for my app
 - In Deploy, deployed from the main branch of my Github repo
 - Viewed app after deployment and checked everything worked


## Known Errors 

- The summernote widget does not respond to screen size in the edit pattern and profile pages
- User cannot upload more than one image for a pattern 
- The sign up page is not styled nicely 
- HTML linter doesn't like duplicate ID in pages where 2 separate elements are rendered on different screen sizes, but only 1 of these elements is ever rendered at a time 


## Citations 

I used a variety of resources to help me understand the new elements that PP4 offers. Of note was the skillshare course by Kalob Taulien. After finishing the LMS, it was extremely beneficial to watch someone put an app together in Django. He explains very clearly what was happening on screen and why. I also spent a lot of time in the boostrap and django docs.
